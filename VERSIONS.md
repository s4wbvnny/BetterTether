# BetterTether — Version 0.8.6

One entry per git push. Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- PATCH: bug fix, refactor, docs
- MINOR: new feature, new package
- MAJOR: breaking API or behavior change (v1+ only)

Pre-release: all versions are v0.x.x until `brew install bettertether` works end-to-end.
v1.0.0 = MVP complete and working on M1/M2/M3.

---

## v0.8.8 — 2026-07-07
- Milestone: Renamed project to BetterTether with full macOS .app + .pkg installer
- What works: Project-wide rename from DroidTether to BetterTether. Native macOS menu-bar .app with launchctl system-domain status detection. .pkg installer with daemon + GUI components. GitHub release workflow builds .pkg, binary tarball, and source zip. CREDITS.md acknowledges original DroidTether.
- Next: v0.9.0 Full integration test passes on real Samsung device.

---

## v0.8.7 — 2026-05-04
- Milestone: Reachability API Bypass & MTU Blackhole Fix
- What works: Documented and identified the macOS 15 `NetworkReachability` API bug which marks `utun` interfaces as offline causing browsers to hang. Instructed users to keep a dummy Wi-Fi connection active. Also added the `mtu 1380` fix for the MTU black hole problem common on 5G tethering.
- Next: Build these fixes directly into the daemon (`daemon.go`) or the launchd script.

---

## v0.8.6 — 2026-04-13
- Milestone: Total Transparency & Technical Depth (Final Stable)
- What works: Established "Supplemental DNS" model for macOS 15; restored 100% of technical verification commands and security posture sections to README. Documentation now includes a comprehensive guide for bypassing macOS 15 native resolver restrictions.
- Technical Narrative: This version solidifies the project's shift from "Experimental System Hijacking" to "Professional Network Bridging." By accepting the OS-level security boundaries of macOS 15 (Tahoe), we have delivered the most stable packet-relay loop to date while providing users with the exact technical commands needed to audit and verify their own connectivity.
- Next: Homebrew Tap readiness audit and official v1.0 planning.

---

## v0.8.5 — 2026-04-12
- Milestone: Multi-Vendor Stability (The "Recovery" Release)
- What works: Successfully unified support for **Samsung (One UI 8.0)** and **Xiaomi (HyperOS 2.0)**. 
- Technical Narrative: After the v0.8.4 regression (see below), we performed a "dirty" manual revert to the stable v0.8.3 baseline (`65aa959`) to isolate hardware behavior. We discovered that Samsung devices require a precise 250ms "Stabilization Sleep" after `SET_CONFIGURATION` and proactive claiming of the Data interface *before* the RNDIS handshake finishes. This version combines the Xiaomi multi-config scanning with these new Samsung-specific stability fixes.
- Next: DNS Interception and IPv6 "Fast Fail-over" (ICMPv6 Reject).

## v0.8.4 — 2026-04-12 (EXTRACTED/DEPRECATED)
- Milestone: Multi-Vendor Compatibility (First Attempt)
- Status: **REGRESSION DETECTED.**
- Issue: This version successfully added Xiaomi HyperOS support but broke Samsung devices on Apple Silicon. The aggressive configuration switching caused a race condition where Samsung devices reported "Alternate Setting 1 not found" for Interface 1, even though the setting was physically present in the descriptor. The build was abandoned in favor of the more robust v0.8.5.
- Milestone: Transparency & Verification (The "Trust" Release)
- What works: Added `.github/SECURITY.md` for private vulnerability reports. Enhanced `README.md` and `PRIVACY.md` with sections on **Why sudo is required**, **Audit Notes** (~2k lines of Go), and **Local-only connectivity**. Verified commit signing via SSH is now active.
- Next: Finalize Homebrew Formula logic for `brew install` support.

## v0.8.2 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: One-Line Installer Stability (Production Ready)
- What works: `install.sh` now correctly handles macOS "Error 5" launchctl bootstrap failures, initializes log files with correct permissions, and ensures `root:wheel` binary ownership. Fixed `ethType` dispatch logic in `relay.go` using an idiomatic tagged switch.
- Next: Finalize Homebrew Formula logic for `brew install` support.

## v0.8.1 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Legal & Transparency (The "Professional" Release)
- What works: Added `LICENSE` (MIT), `PRIVACY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Verified full compatibility with **Android 16 (One UI 8.0)** on **macOS Tahoe 26.3.1(a)**. The project is now legally documented and ready for public contributions.
- Next: Finalize Homebrew Formula logic for `brew install` support.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: One-Line Binary Distribution (Apple Silicon)
- What works: Automated GitHub Release pipeline for `darwin/arm64`. `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` scripts enable one-liner setup via `curl`. Standardized system paths used for the background daemon (`/usr/local/bin` and `/etc/bettertether`). The project is now effectively "Plug & Play" for any M-series Mac user without requiring a local Go compiler.

## v0.7.2 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Release Automation Permissions Fix
- What works: Explicit `contents: write` permissions and `pkg-config` dependency added to GitHub Actions to allow successful CGO compilation and automated asset uploading.

## v0.7.1 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: "One-Touch" Installation Scripts
- What works: Created `install.sh` at repository root. Added `--config` flag to `bettertether` binary. Standardized CLI to support global system configurations.

## v0.6.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Full network connectivity — DHCP + ARP + Ping working
- What works: Complete 4-step DHCP handshake (Discover→Offer→Request→ACK) with Android's randomized subnet. Dynamic ARP responder answers phone's ARP queries for our assigned IP. Samsung MAC randomization workaround auto-detects the phone's real current MAC from live traffic. Gratuitous ARP pre-populates phone's ARP cache. Bidirectional ICMP ping confirmed at ~5.9ms avg latency with 0% packet loss.
- What's broken: No default route injection yet (internet doesn't flow through phone). IP is hardcoded to DHCP-assigned values.
- Next: Default route injection, DNS forwarding, internet connectivity through phone.

---

## v0.5.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Packet Relay Engine
- What works: Bidirectional shuttle service over USB Bulk Endpoints. Reads IP packets from macOS `utun`, synthesizes Ethernet headers, wraps in RNDIS encapsulation, and pushes to Android. Strips RNDIS headers from Android replies and writes to `utun`.
- Next: IP assignment and DHCP handling.

---

## v0.4.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: utun interface creation
- What works: Native macOS virtual interface creation (`utun`). The daemon now spawns a real network interface on the Mac when the phone connects.
- Next: Packet relay engine (Bulk transfer).

---

## v0.3.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: RNDIS handshake working (INIT/QUERY/SET)
- What works: Raw USB Control transfers for RNDIS encapsulated commands; `INIT` handshake; `QUERY MAC` address retrieval; `SET` packet filter to enable promiscuous data mode. **Confirmed on real device.**
- What's broken: No actual data transfer (bulk transfer) implemented yet.
- Next: `internal/tun/utun.go` creation and bulk packet relay.

---

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: USB device detection + hotplug watcher
- What works: `libusb` device monitoring, RNDIS hardware identification, and background daemon. **Validated on real Samsung Galaxy hardware.**
- What's broken: Handshake logic (requires `internal/rndis`); connection drops immediately after detection (expected).
- Next: Build `internal/rndis` handshake sequences (INIT/QUERY/SET).

---

## v0.1.2 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Internal structure + Config loader
- What works: Package layout with READMEs, `config/config.go`, Go dependencies in `go.mod`.
- Next: `internal/usb/vidpid.go` and `internal/usb/watcher.go`.

---

## v0.1.1 — 2026-03-28
- Milestone: Repo restructure + Go scaffold
- What works: documented layout (`docs/`, `config/`, `launchd/`, `Formula/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`), minimal `bettertether` binary (`--version`), `make build` / `go test ./...`
- What's broken: daemon behavior (USB/RNDIS/utun/DHCP not implemented)
- Next: `internal/usb`, `internal/rndis`, config loader in `config/config.go`

---

## v0.1.0 — 2025-03-28
- Milestone: Repository scaffold
- What works: docs, file structure, Makefile skeleton
- What's broken: everything (no code yet)
- Next: Set up go.mod, implement internal/usb/device.go, internal/usb/vidpid.go
- Author: PrincePal
